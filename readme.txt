----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a an image enhancement tool with some basic features added to modify different parameters
of an image. The algorithm that is used to define the functionality of this tool came out from 
the concept of histogram equalization, gamma correction, log transformation, spatial
filtering as part of image processing. Experimental results showthat the developed tool 
can be used to perform several image enhancement operations which includes overall brightness,
contrast details in shadow areas and overall sharpness of the image.
